# Altius
Altius is a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) which is being developed as part of [RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series#wiki_version_2020).

The goal of this event is to follow alongside [this tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/part-0/) over the span of many weeks and eventually have a complete game at the end.

## Building
Altius uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
```
$ git clone https://github.com/yeaFern/altius.git
$ cd altius
$ build
```
## Development
Coming soon.
